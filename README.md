# 📦 Next.js 15 Project — 
## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is built with Next.js 15, a powerful React framework for building modern, high-performance web applications. Next.js enables server-side rendering (SSR), static generation (SSG), file-based routing, API routes, and fullstack capabilities — all with excellent performance and SEO support.
